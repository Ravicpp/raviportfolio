                <h2>RAVI PANDEY</h2>
                <p>Ravi is the founder of H+ Performance. 

                    He has been working as a Personal Trainer since 2021. Being never particularly good at sport when he was at school, Ravi found that he actually just really enjoyed fitness, and through that fell into the fitness industry after gaining his BA from the University of Birmingham. 
                     
                    Ravi's main areas of interest are powerlifting, ultra running and nutrition, and holds a qualification from the kolkata only evidence based nutrition course as an MNU Certified Nutritionist. Ravi's approach to coaching his clients is about educating and empowering them with knowledge that cuts thorough much of the dogma that surrounds the fitness industry. 
                    
                    He now coaches people to get fit, build strength, and achieve amazing things.</p>
